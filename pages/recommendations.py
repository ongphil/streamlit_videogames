Based on our analysis, here are some strategic recommendations to enhance the success of video games on Steam:
1. **Genre Focus**: Invest in genres that consistently receive positive reviews and have growing popularity, such as Action games that seem pretty popular.
2. **Positive Ratings by Year of Release**: There is no clear correlation between the year of release and the number of positive ratings. This suggests that the success of a game, in terms of positive reviews, does not strongly depend on its release year.
3. **Most Reviews by Year of Release**: There is no clear correlation between the year of release and reviews with a high review ratio.  But with more and more games being released every year, the competition is getting fiercer.
